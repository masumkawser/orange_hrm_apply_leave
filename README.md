3. **Overlapping Leave Dates**: Confirm the system prevents users from applying for leave on dates that overlap with an existing application.

4. **Maximum Leave Limit**: Validate the system restricts users from applying for leave beyond the allowed duration.

5. **Insufficient Leave Balance**: Ensure the system notifies users when they try to apply for leave without enough leave balance.

6. **Approval Workflow**: Verify that submitting a leave application triggers the appropriate approval process.

7. **Invalid Date Format**: Check that the system displays an error message when users enter an incorrectly formatted date.

8. **Leave Cancellation**: Ensure users can cancel submitted leave applications successfully.

9. **Leave History Display**: Verify that submitted leave applications appear correctly in the leave history section.

10. **Leave Status Notification**: Confirm that users receive notifications when their leave application is approved, rejected, or updated.
